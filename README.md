# Garments & Goods

<em>Garments & Goods</em> is a mock ecommerce website. I built this website to experiment with Gatsby (and its available plugins), GraphQL, and React functional components. I also wanted to familiarize myself more with the design and features of a typical ecommerce website.

## View Website

You can view Garments & Goods [here](https://garmentsandgoods.netlify.app), or just enter <em>https://garmentsandgoods.netlify.app</em> in your browser's address bar.

## Built with

- React Function Components

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and available Gatsby plugins

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

  - Used to query page content from markdown files.

- [GraphiQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/running-queries-with-graphiql/)

  - Handles swipe event on images when user is on a mobile device.
